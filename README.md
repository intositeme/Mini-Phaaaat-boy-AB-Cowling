# Mini-Phaaaat-boy-AB-Cowling
mini/afterburner + Stealth burner inspired tool head mod.

Was done with intentions to be used on the Voron v0.1 without needing additional mods to the x carrier. Currently only supports Sherpa Mini extruder or those with similar mounting holes.

Only supports Dragon styled hotends, decided to use a 4 screws to attached the hotend as found 2 wasn't enough for me.

## Do let me know how it performs for you :)
